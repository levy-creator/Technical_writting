## Technical writting
We are writing a README file for a project. The README is typically the first file a user will see when they visit your project's repository. It should explain what the project is, how to set it up, how to use it, and any other relevant information.
Structure of a README:
1. Project Title: The name of the project.
2. Description: A brief description of what the project does and why it is useful.
3. Table of Contents (Optional): For longer READMEs, you might want to add a table of contents.
4. Installation: How to install and set up the project.
5. Usage: How to use the project, with examples if possible.
6. Contributing: If you want others to contribute, you can include guidelines for contributing.
7. License: Information about the license for the project.
8. Acknowledgments: If you want to thank someone or mention where you got inspiration.
Syntax:
Since READMEs are usually written in Markdown (with the file extension `.md`), we use Markdown syntax.
Common Markdown Syntax:
- Headers: Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
- Emphasis: `*italic*` or `_italic_`, `**bold**` or `__bold__`.
- Lists: 
  - Unordered: use `-`, `*`, or `+`
  - Ordered: use numbers followed by a period (e.g., `1.`, `2.`)
- Links: `[text](url)`
- Images: `![alt text](image_url)`
- Code: 
  - Inline: wrap with backticks: `` `code` ``
  - Block: use triple backticks (with optional language for syntax highlighting):
    ````markdown
    ```python
    print("Hello")
    ```
    ````
- Blockquotes: use `>`
- Horizontal Rule: `---`, `***`, or `___`
Example README:
```markdown

```
## Usage
How to use your project. For example:
```python

```
## Contributing
If you'd like others to contribute, explain how. For example:
1. Fork the project.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

## Acknowledgments
- Hat tip to anyone whose code was used.
- Inspiration.
- etc.
```
Note: The above is a basic template. You can add more sections as needed, such as:
- Features: List the features of your project.
- Tests: How to run the tests.
- FAQ: Frequently asked questions.
Remember to keep the README updated as the project evolves.
